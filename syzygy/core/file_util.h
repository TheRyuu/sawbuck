// Compares two paths, determining if they both refer to the same object.
//
// This test is read-only, and as such it is possible for the test to fail.
// This can occur if neither of the paths exist, yet they do in fact refer to
// the same file via some aliasing mechanism (junctions, mounts, etc). In that
// case this will return kUnableToCompare. To attempt a comparison in this case
// both paths will be converted to absolute paths using the current working
// directory. If the paths are identical we can infer that the files will be
// the same (but not vice versa). To get a solid answer at least one of the
// paths must exist.
//
// @param path1 the first path to compare.
// @param path2 the second path to compare.
// @returns a FilePathCompareResult, described above.

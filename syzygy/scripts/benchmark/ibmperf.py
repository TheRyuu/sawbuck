"""Wrappers for the IBM Performance Inspector toolkit.

This module provides thin wrappers for the IBM Performance Inspector toolkit,
which unfortunately does not expose any interface other than the command-line.
The toolkit, as well as supporting documentation and examples, may be found
here:

  http://perfinsp.sourceforge.net/index.html

The module defines the following classes:

  Error: The exception type that is used by the module.
  IbmPerfTool: A base class containing utility functions for running
      toolkit utilities, automatically ensuring it is installed.
  HardwarePerformanceCounter: Class for controlling and querying hardware
      performance counters on a per-process basis.

  This class is intended to be used via a simple Start/Query/Stop interface.
  Not that Query must be called while the counters are running (prior to
  calling Stop), as all data is discarded upon calling Stop. Example usage:

  hpc = HardwarePerformanceCounter(ibmperf_dir="C:\ibmperf\bin")
  hpc.Start(["CYCLES", "NONHALTED_CYCLES", "TLB_MISSES"],
            PrivilegeLevel.USER)

  ... run some benchmark here ...

  hpc.Stop()

  To get a list of available metrics and their descriptions, simply inspect
  the |metrics| dict. To determine which of these are free (do not occupy
  a hardware counter) and non-free (require a dedicated hardware counter),
  look at the sets |free_metrics| and |non_free_metrics|.

  It is possible for the utilities to stop working in the middle of a
  performance run. If this happens, the likely culprit is that the kernel
  took an in-place update, and the kernel patch created by the toolkit
  driver installation was overwritten. The only solution is to reinstall
  the driver and run the tests again.

  Attributes:
    free_metrics: A list of metrics that may be measured without occupying
        a hardware counter.
    max_counters: The maximum number of hardware counters that may be used
        simultaneously.
    metrics: A dict of valid metrics, with metric names as keys and their
        descriptions as values.
    non_free_metrics: A list of metrics that require a hardware counter.

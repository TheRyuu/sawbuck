// Implements the CallTraceService interface (see "call_trace_rpc.idl".
// For the most basic usage:
//
//   trace::service::Service::Instance().Start(false);
//
// This will access and launch a static instance of the service using a
// default configuration. Specifying false, as in the above example,
// will cause the call to be blocking; the call will not return until
// the service is shutdown via the RequestShutdown() method. Specifying
// true for the parameter to Start() will cause the Start() method to
// return immediately, running the service in the background.
//
// Some mechanism to trigger a call to RequestShutdown() should be
// provided to the operator of the service; for example, a signal handler
// on SIGINT and/or SIGTERM, an event listening listening for a shutdown
// Message, an IO loop waiting on a socket or Event, etc. The service
// can also stopped remotely via an RPC call to CallTraceControl::Stop().

// Declares the basic block layout transform. This transform is responsible for
// applying a fully specified basic block layout, allowing for basic blocks to
// be ordered within a block, and split across blocks and sections. A basic
// block layout also specifies a section and block ordering. This transform
// modifies the provided order in-place so that it can be applied to the
// post-transform image using the standard ExplicitOrderer.

// A class that transforms a block graph at the basic block level, ordering
// basic blocks within blocks, and splitting basic blocks across blocks and
// sections (creating and modifying sections as necessary). Intended to be
// paired with an ExplicitOrderer in order to fully transform and order an
// image.
//
// There is no mechanism provided to explicitly delete a section. However, a
// section that contains no blocks post-ordering will be implicitly deleted.
//
// The provided Order is modified as follows:
//
// (1) Section specifications that cause new sections to be created will have
//     their id's filled out with the id of the newly created section.
// (2) Block specifications that include basic-block information (a non-empty
//     OffsetVector) will have their block pointer updated to point to the
//     newly created block, thus preventing the order from holding dangling
//     pointers. Additionally, the OffsetVector will be cleared as the BB
//     offsets are now meaningless in the context of the new block.
//
// Post-transformation the Order is a simply block-level ordering, with the
// BB-level ordering having been applied and extracted out of the Order. At
// this point it is able to be fed into an ExplicitOrderer for final ordering.

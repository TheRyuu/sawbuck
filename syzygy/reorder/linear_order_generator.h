// An implementation of a Reorderer. The LinearOrderGenerator simply orders code
// blocks in the order that they were executed as seen in the call-trace.
// If data ordering is enabled, all data blocks referred to by a code block
// are assumed to have been touched when the code block was executed, and they
// are output in that order.
//
// If multiple runs of the instrumented binary are seen in the trace files, each
// run will be processed independently, and for each unique block, the count of
// how many runs in which its execution was seen is maintained. Blocks are first
// sorted by the number of individual runs in which they were seen (decreasing),
// and then sorted by the order in which they were seen. For the special case
// of blocks that were only seen in a single run of the binary, these are
// separated by run and then sorted by time seen.
//
// Consider a trace file that contains 3 runs of an executable. The generated
// ordering will be as follows:
//
// code seen in all 3 runs, code seen in any 2 runs, code seen only in 1st run,
//     code seen only in 2nd run, code seen only in 3rd run
//
// In the case where there is a single run of the instrumented binary, the
// ordering will be a simple ordering of blocks by order of execution, as per
// our original proof-of-concept ordering.

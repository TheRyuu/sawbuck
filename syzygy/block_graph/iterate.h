// any number of blocks to the block-graph. It is constrained to be allowed
// to delete only the current block being handled by the callback.
//
// The iteration will only visit those blocks that were prexisting in the
// BlockGraph. That is, if the callback causes new blocks to be generated those
// blocks will never be visited and passed to the callback.
//
// @param callback the callback to invoke for each pre-existing block in the
//     block graph.
// @param block_graph the block graph that is to be iterated. This is non
//     const as the callback function may modify the block graph as the
//     iteration proceeds.

// A class that attempts to disassemble a function into basic blocks.
//
// Given a function block (dubbed macro block), this disassembler attempts to
// cut it up into sequences of contiguous instruction runs and data blocks. A
// contiguous instruction run is defined as a set of instructions that under
// normal operation will always run from start to end. This class requires that
// all external references to addresses within a function block have an
// associated label.

// This class re-disassembles an already-processed code block (referred to
// herein as a macro block) and breaks it up into basic blocks.
//
// A basic block is defined here as one of:
//
// 1) A series of code instructions that will be executed contiguously.
// 2) A chunk of data (as determined by it being labeled as such).
// 3) Padding (or unreachable code)
//
// The break-down into basic blocks happens in six passes:
//
// 1) Code disassembly starting from the block's inbound code references. This
//    carves all of the basic code blocks and creates control flow (successor)
//    relationships. While the basic blocks are being created, intra-block
//    successors cannot be resolved and are instead referenced by block offset;
//    inter-block successors are immediately resolved.
// 2) Data block construction to carve out statically embedded data.
// 3) Padding block construction to fill any gaps.
// 4) Copying all inbound references (referrers) to their corresponding
//    basic block.
// 5) Copying all references originating in the block to their corresponding
//    basic block.
// 6) Wiring up all unresolved intra-block successors.
//
// The block to be decomposed must have been produced by a successful
// PE decomposition (or some facsimile thereof).

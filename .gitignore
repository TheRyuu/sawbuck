# Ignore GYP generated Visual Studio 2010 artifacts.
# Note: This excludes *.xml, which is rather heavy handed. The
#     generated VS2010 projects each have a project.xml file created
#     (which is unfortunate, as one can easily envision such a file
#     being included in a given project). As, thus far, we haven't
#     had occasion to include a *.xml file, we'll default to needing
#     to jump through a small hoop to remember to add one if the need
#     arises.
